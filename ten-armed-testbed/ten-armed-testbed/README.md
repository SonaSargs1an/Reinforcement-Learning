# Ten-Armed Testbed

## Overview  
This project implements the **Ten-Armed Testbed**, a standard benchmarking environment in Reinforcement Learning for evaluating and comparing action-value methods such as **Îµ-greedy**, **optimistic initialization**, and **UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)**.

The testbed simulates a k-armed bandit problem (with `k=10`) where each arm provides a reward drawn from a stationary or non-stationary distribution.
