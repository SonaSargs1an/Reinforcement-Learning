# Random Walk

## Overview  
This project implements the classic **Random Walk** problem, often used in Reinforcement Learning to illustrate fundamental concepts of Markov processes, value estimation, and prediction.

The environment consists of a linear chain of states where an agent moves left or right with equal probability until it reaches an absorbing terminal state.
