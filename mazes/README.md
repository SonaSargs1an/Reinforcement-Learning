🌀 Maze-Based Reinforcement Learning Environments  

This folder is part of the **Reinforcement-Learning** repository created by **SonaSargs1an**.  
It explores how agents trained with reinforcement learning can **discover paths, avoid traps, and reach goals** inside grid-based maze environments.  

Maze simulations are one of the clearest ways to illustrate how RL agents learn through **interaction, feedback, and adaptation** — making them perfect for both experimentation and teaching.

🌍 Overview  

The **Maze Environment** module provides a playground for training and analyzing RL algorithms in discrete, rule-based spaces.  
Here, each maze is a set of cells representing possible agent states, and the goal is to learn the best sequence of moves to reach the exit efficiently.  

This module enables you to:
- Implement and test **multiple RL algorithms**  
- Compare exploration strategies and hyperparameters  
- Track and visualize learning performance over time  
- Understand the core RL mechanisms like policy updates and reward shaping

 🔢 Environment Design  

A maze environment consists of:
- **States** — each accessible cell represents a unique position of the agent.  
- **Actions** — possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right).  
- **Rewards** — numerical feedback for progress or mistakes.  
- **Terminal conditions** — success when reaching the goal, or failure if trapped.  

Rewards are typically designed as:
- 🟢 +1 for reaching the goal  
- ⚪ small negative value for each move (encouraging shorter paths)  
- 🔴 larger penalties for collisions or invalid actions  

These simple rules allow the agent to learn complex navigation strategies over time.

🧠 Algorithms and Learning Strategies  

| Algorithm | Type | Summary |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Q-Learning** | Off-policy | Learns optimal Q-values using maximum future return. |
| **SARSA** | On-policy | Updates estimates using the next action actually taken. |
| **DQN (Deep Q-Network)** | Function approximation | Employs neural networks to approximate Q-values in larger mazes. |

Each agent interacts with the maze environment, gradually improving its decision policy by balancing **exploration** and **exploitation**.  

Learning Loop
1. Observe current position (state).  
2. Select an action using ε-greedy exploration.  
3. Move within the maze and receive a reward.  
4. Update the value function or Q-table.  
5. Continue until the episode ends.

⚙️ Core Parameters  

Key hyperparameters affecting learning performance:
- **α (learning rate)** — controls how strongly new information overwrites old.  
- **γ (discount factor)** — determines how much future rewards matter.  
- **ε (exploration rate)** — governs randomness in action choice.  

Tuning these parameters influences how quickly and effectively the agent converges toward an optimal policy.
