# Windy Gridworld (Reinforcement Learning)

## Overview  
This project implements the classic **Windy Gridworld** environment from Sutton & Barto's *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*.  
It demonstrates the use of **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)** learning in a grid environment affected by wind â€” a core example of on-policy temporal-difference control.
