# Reinforcement Learning Projects Collection


Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, RL learns from the consequences of actions, exploring and exploiting strategies over time. It has applications in robotics, game playing, finance, and more.

This repository contains 10 projects demonstrating key RL concepts and algorithms through classic environments and problems.



## Projects Overview

### 1. Blackjack  
Implements the Blackjack game using Monte Carlo control methods. Demonstrates exploring starts and ε-soft policies to learn an optimal strategy in a stochastic environment.

### 2. Cliff Walking  
Classic gridworld problem illustrating SARSA and Q-learning algorithms. The agent learns to navigate a grid with risky cliff states while maximizing return.

### 3. Gambler's Problem  
Dynamic Programming solution to the gambler’s problem. Uses value iteration to find an optimal betting policy to reach a goal.

### 4. Gridworld - Dynamic Programming (DP)  
Solves the Gridworld environment using policy evaluation, policy iteration, and value iteration methods. Highlights tabular DP techniques.

### 5. Gridworld - Markov Decision Process (MDP)  
Extends Gridworld with full MDP definitions including reward and transition dynamics. Uses classical algorithms to compute optimal policies.

### 6. Infinite Variance  
Explores challenges in off-policy learning, showing how naive importance sampling can lead to infinite variance in value estimates.

### 7. Random Walk  
Simulates a simple random walk to compare TD(0) and Monte Carlo prediction methods for value function estimation.

### 8. Ten-Armed Testbed  
Benchmark k-armed bandit environment comparing different exploration strategies like ε-greedy, optimistic initialization, and UCB.

### 9. Tic-Tac-Toe  
Reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe through self-play and state-value function updates.

### 10. Windy Gridworld  
Implements the Windy Gridworld problem demonstrating SARSA in a grid environment with wind dynamics, showing on-policy temporal difference learning.
