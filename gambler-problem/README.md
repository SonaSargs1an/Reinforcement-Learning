# Gambler Problem

## Overview
The **Gambler's Problem** is a classic example in Reinforcement Learning introduced by Sutton and Barto.  
It models a gambler who bets on the outcome of a coin toss, aiming to reach a certain monetary goal.  
At each step, the gambler can stake any amount of their current capital, winning or losing based on the probability of the coin toss. The objective is to maximize the probability of reaching the goal before losing all the money.

This project implements a solution to the Gambler's Problem using dynamic programming techniques to find the optimal policy.
